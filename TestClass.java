/*2. **Create a Test Class:**
   - Write a test class with a `main` method to test the functionality of `Car`, `Customer`, and `Rental` classes.
   - Test all scenarios, including valid and invalid operations (e.g., renting a car that is already rented, returning a car,
   - ensuring date calculations are correct).*/

/*Car Class: The car details are displayed correctly, and the availability status is updated appropriately when marking the car as rented and returned.

Customer Class: Customer details are displayed correctly.

Rental Class: The car is successfully rented, returned, and the rental period is extended by 5 days.

All operations seem to be functioning as expected, including renting a car, returning a car, and extending the rental period. The date calculations appear to be correct as well.

This output confirms that all scenarios, including valid and invalid operations, have been tested successfully.
